This is an ancient architectural model, which is my freshman winter vacation assignment. The idea for building this model starts from the bottom of the building, followed by stairs, columns, the first floor, and the second floor. On the columns used to establish the model, several functions such as "symmetry", "alignment", and "rotation" were used, as ancient architecture has strong symmetry, making it reasonable to use them; Secondly, FFD4 * 4 * 4 and FFD3 * 3 * 3 were used in the construction of the vertical ridges and tiles of the model, which is also my favorite feature in the modeling process because it can accurately achieve the bending effect;
