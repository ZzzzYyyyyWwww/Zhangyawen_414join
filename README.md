# Zhangyawen_414join<br>
Hello everyone,my name is ZhangYawe.I’m from Chongqing.I am majored in Digital Technology Major of New Media College.It’s my great honor to introduce myself.<br>
I have two years of experience as a monitor in high school.In my spare time,I like to watch TV.I think it’s a good opportunity to improve my ability of aesthetic.I can operate video editing software skillfully.Besides I’m curious about the process of making software and I hope I can make an interesting software with the leadership of the team.Addition,I am an excellent communicator and active listener.But I lack creativity.In my opinion,joining 414lab not only learn a lot of professional knowledge but also enhance ability of innovation.<br>
Finally,I’m very keen on 414lab and it is something will stick to for my life.If I get the the chance ,I will work hard for it.<br>
Thank you！
